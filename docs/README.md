# OpenFuel Documentation Index

This index is the canonical navigation entry for project documentation.

## Product promise
OpenFuel is built around one promise:

- Log what you ate in under 10 seconds, and know what it means.

## Active documents (source of truth)
- Product vision: `docs/product-vision.md`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
- Roadmap (Phase 32 to Phase 50): `docs/roadmap.md`
- Provider contract: `docs/provider_contract.md`
- Threat model: `docs/threat-model.md`
- Verification and deterministic gates: `docs/verification.md`
- Security policy: `SECURITY.md`
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Phase 35 Review A: `docs/reviews/phase35-review-a.md`
- Phase 40 Review B: `docs/reviews/phase40-review-b.md`

## Historical archive
Superseded plans and reviews are stored in:

- `docs/archive/2026-02-11/`

Archive content is preserved for traceability only and is not the active planning baseline.

## Documentation ownership rules
- Update active docs before starting a new implementation phase.
- Treat `docs/roadmap.md` as the single forward roadmap.
- If a doc statement is not true in code, document it as deferred work.
- Keep wording factual, concise, and testable.
