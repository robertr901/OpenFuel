# OpenFuel Product Vision

## Product promise
OpenFuel exists to deliver one experience promise:

- Log what you ate in under 10 seconds, and know what it means.

## Who OpenFuel is for
OpenFuel is for Android users who want fast nutrition logging with clear, trustworthy feedback and low cognitive load.

## What OpenFuel is
- A practical daily nutrition ledger.
- A calm tool for making better food decisions through clearer data.
- A product that prioritises speed, clarity, and confidence in every core flow.

## What OpenFuel is not
- Not a social feed.
- Not a gamified pressure app.
- Not an opaque recommendation engine.
- Not a growth-at-all-costs product.

## First-minute experience
The first minute should be coherent and measurable:
1. Goal profile selection in 20 seconds or less.
2. First meal logged in 30 seconds or less.
3. Immediate, understandable daily summary.
4. Visible trust cues so users understand where data came from.

## Core jobs to be done
1. Fast daily logging
- Users can capture known foods quickly without fighting the interface.

2. Clear daily interpretation
- Users can understand progress without reading dense screens.

3. Trust in imported data
- Users can see source and completeness cues before relying on data.

## Product principles
- Utility first: every screen should reduce work.
- Calm interaction: avoid visual noise and manipulative prompts.
- Reversible actions: corrections are expected and easy.
- Trust by design: show confidence cues and uncertainty where needed.
- Deterministic quality: behaviour and tests should be repeatable.

## Retention stance
Retention is earned through usefulness:
- faster logging,
- clearer feedback,
- trusted data cues,
- optional reminders only when user-enabled and controlled.

## Non-goals for this roadmap horizon
- No dark-pattern engagement mechanics.
- No hidden behaviour changes tied to background triggers.
- No broad feature expansion before core-loop quality is strong.
