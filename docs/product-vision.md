# OpenFuel Product Vision

## Product pillars
- **Privacy-first, local-first**: All nutrition logs live on device by default; cloud features are opt-in and clearly explained.
- **Low-friction daily loop**: Capture meals quickly and accurately with minimal taps and sensible defaults.
- **Trustworthy data**: Transparent calculations, clear provenance of foods, and consistent totals every day.
- **Delightful, accessible UI**: Clean typography, readable spacing, and accessibility-friendly layouts.
- **Resilient offline**: The core experience works without network access, every time.

## Key differentiators
- **Offline-first by design** with explicit, optional online lookups.
- **No trackers, no ads**; data stays local unless the user chooses to export/share.
- **Exportable, inspectable data** in a documented JSON format.
- **Clear nutrition math**: visible macros and totals, predictable units, and safe defaults.
